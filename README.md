SEV300 – Reinforced Concrete and Steel Structures 
Assessment 2 – Concrete Design Report 
1. Introduction: 
The   Design   Project   is   intended   to   provide   a   realistic   design   project   scenario.   Students will produce design deliverables    similar to those in a design consultancy office. A   reinforced concrete six-story   building   must   be designed to accommodate car   parking on   the   ground   floor,   offices   on   the   1st   –   4th   floors,   and   the   fifth   floor   for   services.   The   developer   approved   a   complete   set   of architectural   drawings   and   made them   available   to the structural   designer.   However,   a collection of   structural   design   drawings   has   been   provided   for   guidance.   The   building   is   for   construction   in   Australia   and   must   adhere   to   Australian design standards and standard   materials. Students must individually   complete the structural analysis and design   of   one   allocated   continuous   beam   and   one   slab   panel. 
2. Scope of work 
The   required task   in this assignment   is to conduct a   complete   structural   design   of one continuous beam of at   least   two spans and one slab panel over   one   of the   beam   spans.
Column and footing design tasks are optional. To   progress the   design   task,   you   can   follow   the steps   below;
Organisation and Assumptions: 
•          Architectural   drawings   of   the building   have   been   provided,   showing   all   dimensions   (in   meters and millimetres) and space    allocations. These drawings show no structural   elements   or   force-resisting members. Lines indicate the boundaries of    each space,   allowing   for   sufficient   circulation   zones. As the   structural   engineer   (the   designer),   you   need   to   recommend   the   location,   type   and   details   of   the   structural   elements   in   the   building.   You   may   assume   the   required   dimensions   if the   drawings   do   not   advise   you.   However, students shall verify all assumptions   in   the   final   design   report.
•          Start   by   laying   out   a   suitable   concrete   beam   grid   for   the   allocated   building   floor.   Floor   frames   typically   consist   of   slabs   and   beams   supported   by   columns   and   walls.   Try   to   use   typical   dimensions   for   the members   and   frame   bays.    Use   the    labelled   grid   and   structural   elements   such   as   beams   and   columns   using   a   unique   code for   each   member   of each type,   i.e. for   beams,   use   B1,   B2, etc., and for   columns,   use   C1,   C2,   etc.
•          As detailed   below, each   student   will   be   allocated   a   design   zone   on   a   specific   floor   level.
•          To   avoid   duplication,   students   must   select   one   continuous   beam   of two   spans   or   more   and one slab   panel within the design   zone. Column and footing designs are optional. 
•          Allocate   a    building   location   and   exposure   class   and   use   that   information   to   select   the   concrete's minimum cover and suitable compressive strength (strength must be   verified   later   in your design).
•          Select suitable materials for the construction   and   specify   the mechanical    properties   you will   use   in your design calculations.
•          Allocate loading and load combinations following   Australian Standards      AS1170      and   identify   likely critical   load combinations.
Concrete Mix Design: 
•             Concrete mix design shall be project and element-specific and must satisfy your   specific   project strength requirements.
•             Mix   design   procedure   shall   follow   the   American   Volumetric   Method,   as   per   Chapter   5
(proportioning   of   concrete   mix)   of   the   textbook   (Properties   and   Design   of   Concrete   Structures, Al-Ameri, 2017).
•             Students shall   design the   concrete   mix for either N32 or N40 Grades.
•             Students shall      select the   Coarse aggregate for the concrete   mix   from the following   options:
a.             Gravel with crushed   particles   as   coarse   aggregate. 
b.             Sub-angular coarse aggregate.
Analysis and Conceptual Design: 
•             Calculate the slab   loads following   the   steps   below:
a.               Nominate a trial slab thickness.
b.             Control the slab   deflection   by   adopting   a span/depth   ratio   equal   to   or   less   than   28.
c.                Define   dead   and   live   loading      ultimate   combination   of   loading.   Show   on   load   summary sketch.
d.             Define the slab tributary area for each supporting beam within your slab   boundary.
e.             Conclude by identifying the critical load for slab   design and beam load    share   from the slab.
•             Conduct   a structural analysis of the   beam   as   below:
a.             Nominate trial beam   cross-sectional   dimensions.
b.             Define dead and   live   loading    ultimate combination   of   loading.   Consider the slab   load transferred   to the supporting beams. Show on load summary sketch.
c.             Control   the   deflection   of   the   beam    by   adopting   a   span/depth ratio   equal   to   or   less than   10.
d.             You   can use   structural   design   software   (e.g.   Space   Gass)   to   analyse   or   use   the   simplified conventional   method.
e.             Calculate the shear along the代 写SEV300 – Reinforced Concrete and Steel Structures Assessment 2
代做程序编程语言 beam   spans   and   show   it   on   SFD.
f.                Calculate the   bending moments along the   beam spans and   display them on   BMD.
g.             Conclude   by identifying the design's   critical   load   actions   (Maximum   BM   and   SF).
Detailed Design: 
•          Students shall provide a detailed design of the allocated structural elements. The   simplified method of structural analysis, adopted in AS3600, shall   be followed.
•             Detailed Design of Reinforced concrete beams and slabs shall comply with the   Australian Standards    AS3600-2009.       Ensure    that    your    sections      meet      the      strength,   safety, and ductility   requirements.
•             Beams    shall    be    designed    as    a    T-shape    (or    inverted    L-    L-shape    for    edge    beams)    for   negative and   positive   moments, shear, serviceability   (deflection) and   rebar details.
•             Design    the      beam    for    the      maximum      moment      along      all      spans      (negative      or      positive   moments),   then   use   the   cross-section   to   calculate   the   required   steel   bars   for   other   locations   in all   spans.
•             Distinguish    between    the    negative    moment    design    (with    top    steel)    and   the      positive   moment design (with   bottom   steel).
•             Selected slabs   shall   be two-way slabs   designed   for   negative   and   positive   moments,   shear,   serviceability (deflection), and   rebar details.
•             Provide   all   calculations   and   ensure you   show   units   and   use   appropriate   figures.
•             Provide    typical    calculations    for    each    element    to    support    the    software    outputs    if    a   design software   has   been   used.
•             Use       the       design       Aids       provided      by      SRIA      to      assist      in      the      design,      particularly      for   reinforcing   size   and   detailing.   Reinforcement   detailing   shall   follow   the   recommended   practice shown   in The   Reinforcement   Detailing   Handbook.
•             The   design shall   be concluded   with   design   summary   sketches.   Sketches   shall   be   drawn   to scale and   include sufficient   information.
